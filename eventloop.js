/*
Letâ€™s take a look at an example to better illustrate the differences between setTimeout and setInterval.

setTimeout(function(){
    
  setTimeout(arguments.callee, 10);
}, 10);
 
setInterval(function(){
  
}, 10);
These two pieces of code may appear to be functionally equivalent, 
at first glance, but they are not. 
Notably the setTimeout code will always have at least a 10ms delay
 after the previous callback execution (it may end up being more, but never less) 
 whereas the setInterval will attempt to execute a callback every 10ms regardless 
 of when the last callback was executed.

 if their is x sec setInternal and it times up so its callback function gets push to Q so u cannot clearTimout() it after ward
